# PER-DT-Gear-Loads-and-Forces
RegenEst will calculated estimated reverse torque experienced by gears based on provided track data and output an adjusted load vector. Using as input to PlanetShaft provides tangential &amp; radial gear forces, planet shaft forces, stresses &amp; failure. Rainflow counting calculates fatigue life based on fluctuating shaft stresses.
